# My Day
1. I woke up and took my dog out for a walk. 
2. After I came back in, I worked on my homework for my other class.
3. I spent *way* too long thinking of what to comment on my classmates' discussion board posts. ![Spongebob Contemplating](https://i.imgflip.com/xt51x.jpg?a487392)
4. I finished up and made myself something to eat. 🍴
5. **It was the most delicious lasagna I've had in a while**
- The last couple of hours are a blur.

### Now I am getting ready for bed.
