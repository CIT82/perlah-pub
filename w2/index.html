      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
    <li> Ada was born in 1815 in England. Though it was not typical at the time, her mother made sure she had a strong education in math and science.</li>
    <li> At 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, who was working on the Difference Engine (an early version of a calculator). She was fascinated by his work, and the two developed a mentorship that shaped her future.</li>
    <li> In 1843, while translating a paper about Babbage's Analytical Engine, Ada added her own detailed notes. She suggested the machine could follow coded instructions, not just crunch numbers. She even imagined it could handle letters, symbols, and music. This is why she's often called the first computer programmer.</li>
    <li> Her notes weren't widely recognized until they were published in 1953, but today they're seen as a visionary leap toward modern computing. </li>
    <li> In 1979, the U.S Department of Defense named the programming language "Ada" in her honor.</li>
